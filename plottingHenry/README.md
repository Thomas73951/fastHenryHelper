# PlottingHenry

Takes CSV file created by `automatedHenry` and automatically plots data from it.

Requires multiple entries in CSV file and therefore a set of runs with different offset values.

Currently only supports changes in one axis, other must be fixed.

- [ ] 3D plotting - support for sweeps in both x and y.
