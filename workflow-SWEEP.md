This workflow is for simulating five different sweeps of the second coil position in one go.

- [fastHwrite_multiSweep.m](fileGen/fastHwrite_multiSweep.m) - defines the sets of sweeps used and creates the files.
- [automatedHenry_sweeps.vbs](automatedHenry/automatedHenry_sweeps.vbs) - set the correct folder, then run. This outputs five results `.csv` files.
